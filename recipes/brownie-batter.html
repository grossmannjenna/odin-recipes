    <h1>Protein Brownie Batter</h1>

    <p>This protein brownie batter is the perfect cure for a sweet tooth or late night craving. It fulfills the sweet craving
        while also bringing you closer to reaching your protein goals. I've even ate this for breakfast in a pinch because of its simplicity
        and quickness.
    </p>

    <p>I've found that the protein powder you use makes or breaks this recipe so try to use a chocolate protein powder that either does not have a 
        strong taste(this is how mine is) or has a rich chocalatey flavor you enjoy. I have also used water in place of milk, and it can be done but the flavor isn't as rich.
        Dairy free milks work the same as regular milk, so no need to worry.
